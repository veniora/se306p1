To get Project2Sample working
Create a file named .bashrc (if does not exist, can check with 'ls -a') in your home directory and append the following line
(NOTE: Replace ~/ros/stacks with PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO/ros/stacks. For example mine is ~/se306p1/ros/stacks)

source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash <br>
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros/stacks:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH <br>
