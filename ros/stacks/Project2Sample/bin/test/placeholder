This document exist only so git is able to exclude the test folder.
Without this folder the bin folder and all it contains would be ignored by git.
By exluding this document from .gitignore the the bin/test/ path remains (as 
well as this document) while everything else that is generated and store in
the folder is not. This require because the tests will not be created unless
the bin/test/ folder exists.
